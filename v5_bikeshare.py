#I wanted to learn how to support multiple input values.
#	For this purpose the code supports comma separated list of cities as an input.
#	Testing example can include cities outside of the CITY_DATA 
#	input: Moscow, Prague, Chicago - will properly recognise that we have data only for Chicago.
#	input: Moscow, Prague, Chicago, Washington - will properly recognise that we have data only for Chicago and Washington.

#I wanted to learn how to handle error in case of missing file.
#	In CITY_DATA I have added entry for Barcelona. 
#	If file barcelona.csv is not present - the error is handled properly.
#	Testing example can include Barcelona mixed with other cities.
#	input: Moscow, Prague, Barcelona, Chicago - will properly recognise that we have data only for Barcelona, Chicago.
#	                                          - will properly handle error in case barcelona.csv is missing	
#	                                          - will properly analyse data for Chicago 

#I also wanted to learn how to handle error for special case: 
#	when key columns are missing from the data file, that would crash load_data function
#	To demonstrate this functionality, I provided additional file barcelona.csv (uploaded with the project file)
#	If you have an option to add barcelona.csv to the existing .csv files in the project, please do so :)
#	If the file barcelona.csv is uploaded to the desired location, you can see error handling for the missing columns
#	columns deleted on puprose from barcelona.csv: [Start Date], [End Date], [Trip Duration] 

#I also wanted to learn how to handle case when column [Trip Duration] is missing
#	In this case I tried to calculate trip duration, if possible

#CITY_DATA, months, days are global variables.
#	This way all functions can use the data (if required).
#	This also simulates that the values in these variables could be imported from external databases etc.
